# ROSJava Audio - https://github.com/cloudspace/rosjava_audio

Audio enabled Ros Nodes for Android

This module provides an audio publisher and subscriber, allowing you to stream and consume live audio from your android devices.

AudioPublisher and AudioSubscriber both take just the topic name as a parameter, and both come with simple pause and unpause methods.

Note: To see these AudioData messages being transmitted on your roscore server instance, you must install the audio-common messages as well.
